**Deep sequence model that can decrypt messages from an enigma machine.**

### How to Run

```python
python cipher_take_home.py
```

Follow the input prompt
- Press 1 if you want to build the model from scratch (ETA 10m)
- Press 2 if you want to use the existing pretrained model (ETA 2m)

### Notebook

Jupyter notebook (Decrypt-cipher.ipynb) has successful run of all the phases of model building
 - generating engima data
 - Building model from generated data
-  or Loading a saved model
-  computing cipher scores on both train and test samples
